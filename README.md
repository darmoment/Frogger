# Frogger

This is my remake of the classic 1981 Arcade Game, _Frogger_!  

This code was created through [Python3](https://www.python.org) and the library [Pygames](https://www.pygame.org/news)!

In this iteration of the game there are the following:
* A playable Frogger character whose goal is to reach one of the three lilypads on the other side of the map
* Collideable cars that are racing down the street, not slowing down for a struggling frog
* Helpful logs that Frogger can use to cross the dangerous lake
* Coins along the way to boost Frogger's morale
* Three lives that can be wasted during the journey

Be sure to have python and pygames downloaded, and enjoy the game!
